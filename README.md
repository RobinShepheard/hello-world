Hello World Github tutorial repo

Greetings. I am a 40yr old mature student who has been playing with Linux for over 20yrs and playing with computers for about 36yrs.

I have in interest in networking and network admin having worked as a system admin and IT manager for a stockbrokers for quite a few years. I am also in the process of learning coding, having played with basic, VB, C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, Pascal and a little x86 assembler in that past but not really mastered any of them.
